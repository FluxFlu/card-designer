# Ashley's Card Designer
A trading card designer I created to aid me in creating a specific card game.

Cards can be saved in a text format to allow them to be imported and editer later, and can also be rendered and exported as images using the html canvas.

## Currently Available Features
 - Name
 - Typeline

## Notes:
 - Text can be formatted by putting a '|' at the beginning of the line and then writing the formatting afterwards. It uses the same syntax as the [CSS font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) specifier.
