# card-designer
A trading card designer I created to aid me in creating a specific card game.

Cards can be saved in a text format to allow them to be imported and editer later, and can also be rendered and exported as images using the html canvas. Allows for custom name, typeline, cost, text, art, and power/toughness. Does not allow for custom templates, as this was created with a specific game in mind.
